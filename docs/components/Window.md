# Window

Window is currently a component that is different than React Native. We create this as a separate component rather than
just creating a window for you in case you want to create multiple windows.

The following creates a window that takes up 50% of the desktop in height, and 20% of the width.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { AppRegistry, Window, App } from 'valence-native';

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <App>
        <Window style={{ height: '50%', width: '20%' }} />
      </App>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('Test', <Example />);
```

as pixel counts, or percentages, where they are treated as percentages of the entire desktop size.
